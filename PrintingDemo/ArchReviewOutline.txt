            Worst report ?

    Build/Releng
        Today - local / individual
            gulp build
            lessc master.less > styles.css
            npm run zip
            aws upload-new-lambda-zip
            gulp serve
            (node demo-server.js)

        Tomorrow
            maven
            associated with dev environment
            terraforming?


    Debugging / Development / Testing Strategies
        demo-server
            printed report view
        local-lambda, or, at least
        local-phantom

        Unit Test Plan

    Still ToDo
        Table Breaking
        Header / Footer Proof
            2 strategies: Phantom vs roll our own

    Issues/Concerns
        Phantom not fully modern browser
            flexbox css support not the same as others ?
        Phantom hard to debug

    Mitigation Strategies
        Further isolation of phantom limitations
        We have the control necessary to work around
            but that can reduce code-reuse
        Local Phantom


    Next Steps
        Table Breaking
        mvn
        integrate with scent-client
            on branch
